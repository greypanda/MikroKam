# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
* A Raspberry Pi. Developed on a Rpi 3, but tested on a Rpi 2.
  
* A Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen. With some work, it will probably work on other displays.
  
* A Raspberry Pi camera. Only the CSI interface is supported. Any compatible camera should work.
